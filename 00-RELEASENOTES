================================================================================
Valkey 8.1.0 RC1  -  Released Thu 11 Feb 2025
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency LOW: This is the first release candidate of Valkey 8.1, with
performance improvements, extended observability and cluster improvements and different bug fixes. 
It includes a new implementation of the Valkey dictionary which is more memory and cache efficient, 
better performance for encryption in transit, reduced replication overhead by offloading work to I/O threads,
faster failover support in cluster mode, major improvements to the active defrag process to reduce the impact on command processing
and different API changes for improved usability. 
Valkey now supports new new check-and-set feature for native STRINGs.
